Welcome :-)

So you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.

Here is a checklist of things to do:

  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.
  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/
  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).
  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)

Looking forward to your great idea!

The Rclone Developers
