<i class="fa fa-server"></i> SFTP
----------------------------------------

SFTP is the [Secure (or SSH) File Transfer
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).

SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern
SSH installations.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`. If the path does not begin with
a `/` it is relative to the home directory of the user.  An empty path
`remote:` refers to the user's home directory.

Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading `/` - Synology is a
good example of this.

Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```

s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config

Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
port = 
pass = 
key_file = 
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this:

See all directories in the home directory

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote directory, deleting any
excess files in the directory.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory

### SSH Authentication ###

The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:

  * Password
  * Key file
  * ssh-agent

Key files should be unencrypted PEM-encoded private key files.  For
instance `/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa`.

If you don't specify `pass` or `key_file` then rclone will attempt to
contact an ssh-agent.

If you set the `--sftp-ask-password` option, rclone will prompt for a
password when needed and no password has been configured.

### ssh-agent on macOS ###

Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS.  The most effective work-around
seems to be to start an ssh-agent in each session, eg

    eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add -A

And then at the end of the session

    eval `ssh-agent -k`

These commands can be used in scripts of course.

### Modified time ###

Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.

Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time after
upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with mod_sftp). If you
are using one of these servers, you can set the option `set_modtime = false` in
your RClone backend configuration to disable this behaviour.

### Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP Connection).

#### --sftp-host

SSH host to connect to

- Config:      host
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_HOST
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "example.com"
        - Connect to example.com

#### --sftp-user

SSH username, leave blank for current username, ncw

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USER
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-port

SSH port, leave blank to use default (22)

- Config:      port
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PORT
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-pass

SSH password, leave blank to use ssh-agent.

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PASS
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-key-file

Path to unencrypted PEM-encoded private key file, leave blank to use ssh-agent.

- Config:      key_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-use-insecure-cipher

Enable the use of the aes128-cbc cipher. This cipher is insecure and may allow plaintext data to be recovered by an attacker.

- Config:      use_insecure_cipher
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USE_INSECURE_CIPHER
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "false"
        - Use default Cipher list.
    - "true"
        - Enables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher.

#### --sftp-disable-hashcheck

Disable the execution of SSH commands to determine if remote file hashing is available.
Leave blank or set to false to enable hashing (recommended), set to true to disable hashing.

- Config:      disable_hashcheck
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_HASHCHECK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP Connection).

#### --sftp-ask-password

Allow asking for SFTP password when needed.

- Config:      ask_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_ASK_PASSWORD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-path-override

Override path used by SSH connection.

This allows checksum calculation when SFTP and SSH paths are
different. This issue affects among others Synology NAS boxes.

Shared folders can be found in directories representing volumes

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --ssh-path-override /volume2/directory

Home directory can be found in a shared folder called "home"

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/home/directory --ssh-path-override /volume1/homes/USER/directory

- Config:      path_override
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PATH_OVERRIDE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-set-modtime

Set the modified time on the remote if set.

- Config:      set_modtime
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SET_MODTIME
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

### Limitations ###

SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and `md5sum`
or `sha1sum` as well as `echo` are in the remote's PATH.
This remote checksumming (file hashing) is recommended and enabled by default.
Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP servers
which are not under your control, and to which the execution of remote commands
is prohibited.  Set the configuration option `disable_hashcheck` to `true` to
disable checksumming.

Note that some SFTP servers (eg Synology) the paths are different for
SSH and SFTP so the hashes can't be calculated properly.  For them
using `disable_hashcheck` is a good idea.

The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty's pageant.

The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher by
default, due to security concerns. This can be re-enabled on a
per-connection basis by setting the `use_insecure_cipher` setting in
the configuration file to `true`. Further details on the insecurity of
this cipher can be found [in this paper]
(http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf).

SFTP isn't supported under plan9 until [this
issue](https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156) is fixed.

Note that since SFTP isn't HTTP based the following flags don't work
with it: `--dump-headers`, `--dump-bodies`, `--dump-auth`

Note that `--timeout` isn't supported (but `--contimeout` is).
