-----------------------------------------

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, eg `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for OneDrive involves getting a token from
Microsoft which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

See the [remote setup docs](/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification
code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require
you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your OneDrive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your OneDrive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an OneDrive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Getting your own Client ID and Key ###

rclone uses a pair of Client ID and Key shared by all rclone users when performing requests by default.
If you are having problems with them (E.g., seeing a lot of throttling), you can get your own
Client ID and Key by following the steps below:

1. Open https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/#/appList, then click `Add an app` (Choose `Converged applications` if applicable)
2. Enter a name for your app, and click continue. Copy and keep the `Application Id` under the app name for later use.
3. Under section `Application Secrets`, click `Generate New Password`. Copy and keep that password for later use.
4. Under section `Platforms`, click `Add platform`, then `Web`. Enter `http://localhost:53682/` in
`Redirect URLs`.
5. Under section `Microsoft Graph Permissions`, `Add` these `delegated permissions`:
`Files.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite`, `Files.Read.All`, `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `offline_access`, `User.Read`.
6. Scroll to the bottom and click `Save`.

Now the application is complete. Run `rclone config` to create or edit a OneDrive remote.
Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret, respectively. rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.

### Modified time and hashes ###

OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

OneDrive personal supports SHA1 type hashes. OneDrive for business and
Sharepoint Server support
[QuickXorHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash).

For all types of OneDrive you can use the `--checksum` flag.

### Deleting files ###

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.  Microsoft
doesn't provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the
trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft's apps or via
the OneDrive website.

### Specific options ###

Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage
system.

#### --onedrive-chunk-size=SIZE ####

Above this size files will be chunked - must be multiple of 320k. The
default is 10MB.  Note that the chunks will be buffered into memory.

### Limitations ###

Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in OneDrive file
names.  These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows
platforms they are common.  Rclone will map these names to and from an
identical looking unicode equivalent.  For example if a file has a `?`
in it will be mapped to `ï¼Ÿ` instead.

The largest allowed file size is 10GiB (10,737,418,240 bytes).

### Versioning issue ###

Every change in OneDrive causes the service to create a new version.
This counts against a users quota.
For example changing the modification time of a file creates a second
version, so the file is using twice the space.

The `copy` is the only rclone command affected by this as we copy
the file and then afterwards set the modification time to match the
source file.

User [Weropol](https://github.com/Weropol) has found a method to disable
versioning on OneDrive

1. Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of the OneDrive Business page.
2. Click Site settings.
3. Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration > Site libraries and lists.
4. Click Customize "Documents".
5. Click General Settings > Versioning Settings.
6. Under Document Version History select the option No versioning.
Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will not remove any previous versions. Your documents are safe.
7. Apply the changes by clicking OK.
8. Use rclone to upload or modify files. (I also use the --no-update-modtime flag)
9. Restore the versioning settings after using rclone. (Optional)

### Troubleshooting ###

```
Error: access_denied
Code: AADSTS65005
Description: Using application 'rclone' is currently not supported for your organization [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] because it is in an unmanaged state. An administrator needs to claim ownership of the company by DNS validation of [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] before the application rclone can be provisioned.
```

This means that rclone can't use the OneDrive for Business API with your account. You can't do much about it, maybe write an email to your admins.

However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account. Have a look at the webdav backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint
